Empirical_model_cycling is the code for the semi-empirical model 
physics_based_model_cycling is a model based on pybamm for cycling, creating a fitting model for less computational and time use.
visulize_fit_curve visulize the physics-based model for cycling togheter with a semi-empirical model for calendar ageing. 
dim_tool_size is a model for calculating the size of a battery with diffrent parameters.
